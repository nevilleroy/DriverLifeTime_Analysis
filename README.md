# Lyft Driver Lifetime Value (LTV) Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the **Lifetime Value (LTV)** of Lyft drivers using comprehensive datasets covering driver, ride, and timing information. The goal is to provide actionable insights into factors influencing driver retention, engagement, and profitability while optimizing Lyft's operational and strategic decisions.

The project includes data processing, LTV calculation, and recommendations to improve driver retention and enhance overall performance.

## Features

- **Data Processing**: Consolidation and transformation of multiple datasets into a master dataset.
- **LTV Calculation**: Detailed computation of Driver LTV, factoring in churn rates, revenue projections, and the time value of money.
- **Driver Engagement Analysis**: Insights into factors affecting driver earnings and engagement patterns over time.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Strategies to boost driver retention and operational efficiency.

## Dataset Description

The analysis integrates three datasets:
1. **Driver Data**: Details about Lyft drivers, including demographics and onboarding dates.
2. **Ride Data**: Information about rides, including distance, duration, and pricing.
3. **Timing Data**: Details about ride timing, such as wait times and delays.

### Data Processing Steps

- Created extra columns to calculate rider costs without prime-time charges and Lyft's profit per ride.
- Employed formulas to compute ride costs and profits considering San Francisco-specific taxes and prime-time pricing:
  - **Base Fare**: `$2.00 + (ride distance in miles) * $1.15 + (ride duration in minutes) * $0.22`
  - **Cost per Ride**: `$1.75 + Base Fare + Base Fare * (ride prime time percentage) + Base Fare * 0.085`
  - **Lyft Profit**: `(Base Fare + Base Fare * (ride prime time percentage)) * 0.20`
- Eliminated duplicate entries and added columns for event time intervals (e.g., pickup delays and trip durations).
- Merged the datasets into a single **master dataset** for analysis.

## Lifetime Value (LTV) Calculation

- Plotted a density histogram of driver lifetimes to identify typical driver tenure.
- Used the median driver lifetime (57 days) for analysis due to a relatively normal distribution.
- Calculated daily revenue generated by drivers and scaled it to an annual figure.
- Adjusted for:
  - **Churn Rate**: 18.28%, reflecting driver attrition over tenure.
  - **Discount Rate**: 10%, accounting for the time value of money.
- **Estimated Driver LTV**: `$3,190.21` over a 57-day expected tenure.

## Key Findings

1. **Prime-Time Engagement**:
   - Positive correlation with LTV.
   - Drivers earn more during peak hours, enhancing overall profitability.
2. **Acceptance Times**:
   - Negative correlation with daily revenue.
   - Faster responses lead to higher earnings due to increased ride completions.
3. **Trip Duration**:
   - Positive correlation with LTV.
   - Longer trips generate higher fares, benefitting both drivers and Lyft.
4. **Engagement Patterns**:
   - Initial onboarding weeks show increased activity, with significant variations across driver cohorts.
5. **Weekly Earnings Variability**:
   - Earnings fluctuate due to demand shifts and driver availability.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Retention Incentives for New Drivers**:
   - Introduce bonuses or incentives during the 8-12 week period to sustain engagement.
2. **Flexible Prime-Time Incentives**:
   - Implement tiered incentives based on demand trends to boost long-term engagement.
3. **Driver Loyalty Program**:
   - Reward drivers for tenure and consistent activity to foster loyalty and reduce churn.
